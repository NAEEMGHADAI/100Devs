Css:
what makes a site responsive:
1) Fluid
2) Elastic
3) Content Decision

1) Fluid:
Fluidity is cheaper (easier) 
if you are using percentage with your width or flex box
Fluidity means as your screen size goes smaller or biggers it kind of responding (it looks ok) 
Fluidity helps us in between our break points 

2) Elastic
it is related to text using rems and ems 
em: what em is doing is looking for its closets parent's font size 

hrml:
<section>
	<p> Spam</p>
<section>

css:
html{
	font-size: 62.5%;
}
section {
	font-size: 20px;
}
p{
	font-size: 1em;
}

here p will look for its closest parent which is section,
here p will have font-size of 20px as 1 em in this instance is 20px as p got its base from its parent
tag with em will look above the ansestor chain until it finds a parent with a font-size thats how it will have its base size

There is problem with ems:
if somebody goes ahead adds a diffrent parent, maybe they put this paragragh inside an article , if that article also have some font-size it will never go to section
and grab its font-size from article.

we have solution for this problem is : rems
rems don't look at parent it looks at html parent (root element)

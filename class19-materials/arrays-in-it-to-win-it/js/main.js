//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["Terminator", "Harry Potter", "Back To the Future"];
console.log(movies);
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movies[0];
console.log(firstMovie);
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrLenght = movies.length;
console.log(arrLenght);
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = movies[arrLenght - 1];
console.log(lastMovie);
